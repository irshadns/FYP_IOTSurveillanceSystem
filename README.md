# FYP_IOTSurveillanceSystem
This is the repo that contains the codebase of our BSCS Final Year Project: IOT Surveillance System.

We basically built an application using Raspberry Pi 3, a camera, motion sensor, siren, and a few electronic components for connecting & power supply.
This has a backend server based on Flask-Python, has a client app based on Flutter with Firebase in the middle.

# HOW IT WORKS?
Motion is detected by a motion sensor through a notification on the mobile app and through the app he can do a live stream of the camera view, has the option to turn ON & turn OFF the siren or
enable it for the auto siren on motion detection.
